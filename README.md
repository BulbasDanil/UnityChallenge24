Welcome to the CARRT Unity Challenge repository! This challenge is designed to test your coding skills as well as your proficiency in collaboration using Git. Follow the instructions below to get started and submit your solutions. 

## Challenge Format

As stated before, the challenge is split between 2 categories. You can choose to do just one or both categories, you don't need to do both categories to submit the challenge. We are curently seeking to hire 4 positions, therefore skillset specialization would be useful.

- [Unity Coding Skills](/UnityCodingChallenge.md) : For those seeking to showcase their skills in C#, Unity, 3D, Game Dev, etc.
- [Web technology integration skills](/WebIntegrationChallenge.md): For those seeking to showcase their Web Development skills. Will include a small portion inside Unity, but the bulk of the work is demonstrating skills working wtih Frontend, Backend, APIs, etc.

Each category will have different levels. You don't have to complete all of them to submit the challenge, feel free to go above and beyond at each level.
